# Adult Dataset Preprocessing

## Overview
This project preprocesses the Adult Income dataset to prepare it for machine learning models.

## Steps Performed
1. Identified categorical and numerical features.
2. Applied Label Encoding to ordinal features.
3. Applied One-Hot Encoding to nominal categorical features.
4. Scaled numerical features using StandardScaler.
5. Compared dataset readiness before and after scaling.
6. Explained the impact of scaling on ML algorithms.


## Outcome
The dataset is fully encoded, scaled, and ready for machine learning.
